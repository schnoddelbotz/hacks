<h2>The (not-yet-just-another) MacOS X menubar/tray-item nfs/rpc quota checker</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Yet a lot of beautiful tools exist to measure/monitor your private mac's <b>local</b> disk
usage. As I was unable to google up anything that does the same thing (at least somehow)
but for <b>remote</b> servers, ... Voila: rpcquota.app. It is intended to
report the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_quota">disk quota</a> usage, as reported by <b>remote</b> <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_(protocol)">NFS</a> servers, that are running the <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a> service <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rpc.rquotad">rquotad</a>.</p>

<p>This tool is <b>useless</b> for the home user but interesting only for people

having their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">home directory</a>
sit e.g. on a Solaris NFS Server. Mac OSX currently (10.5 / Leopard) provides
no mechanisms to make users aware of quotas configured on such rquotad enabled
NFS servers. In Finder, users will get the partition's free space reported
when looking in their homedirectory -- which will ever likely be much
more than their active quotas. This might work better with BSD-Style
quotas (i.e. mounting clientside e.g. from OSXServer), but simply is
inexistant when rquotad is required.
This tool tries to fill this gap. In three amazing colors.</p>
<h3>How does it...?</h3>
<p>I have the hope to keep it autoconfigureable -- as long as
nobody complains, rpcquota.app will:</p>
<ul>
<li>walk through the system's list of mounts and</li>
<li>try to match the nfs-type mounts against the user's homedir or</li>
<li>try to match the nfs-type mount's basename against the username</li>
</ul>
If it found a valid mountpoint (i.e. one that it "thinks" of it is
the user's nfs mounted homedirectoy), rpcquota.app will contact the nfs
mount's server via rpc to retreive usage stats. If rpcquota.app did
well so far, it will set the menu bar item color according to quota
results. This is currently hardcoded (shame on) me: up to 90%:
green, then orange, red if above 95%.
<h3>What does it look like?</h3>
<p>Not too beautiful, to be honest...</p>
<img style="float:left; margin:1em" src="rpcquota-screenshot.png">
<p>... but still more mac-like than doing it in a shell :-).<br>
Besides the colors named above, gray background on the menu icon
implies no (or bad) quota results. The Tooltip as well as the menu's
first item will display user messages / quota immediately after launch,
then re-scan every 60 minutes (which can be turned off).</p>
<h3>How to...</h3>
<p>
Download and open the <a href="rpcquota.dmg">rpcquota.dmg (99kB) from here</a>,
and drag-drop the app icon to a destination folder of your choice (e.g. /Applications).
rpcquota.app comes as a universal binary, running on Mac OS X Tiger and greater.
Add to your login items in User Preferences if desired. If you still think
you might want to use this tool, but it does not work for you, please
provide feedback/translations/flames by <a href="hackerj+rpcquota@ee.ethz.ch">mail</a>.
Sources available sooner or later after cleanup or on request. Use rpcquota.app at your own
risk!</p>
<h3>Q & A</h3>
<p><b>Q: How much does it cost?</b><br>
A: The time to download and unpack. It's free. Simply not OSS (yet).
<p><b>Q: What about ..... quota system support?</b><br>
A: rpcquota.app supports <b>exclusively</b> RPC rquotad requests and
is only tested against solaris servers. it does <b>not care at all</b>
about any local disk, or even <a href="http://sial.org/howto/osx/quota/">
os x native BSD quotas</a> to display space usage. No changes planned.
</p>
<p><b>Q: Which dependencies does rpcquota.app have?</b><br>
A: It only relies on common system libs, no external things.
</p>
<p><b>Q: How do I tell which version I have installed?</b><br>
A: This thing works ok for me, so I didn't release something "better" yet.
Any future release will have a version info. Or a changelog. And stuff.
</p>
<p><b>Q: Bugs?</b><br>
A: Oh yes, it currently leaks at least 30 bytes a hour. Fix by buying memory, log out at least once a year or bug me to improve. Err, well, yes -- and it does not bother the number of files limits reported by rquotad (yet).

This app would have been impossible without <a href=
"http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/TOMZO/Quota-1.6.3/Quota.xs">cpan's
Quota.pm</a>, which provided some magic glue code to make rpc quota
work (i.e. compile) on osx. Opensolaris' <a href=

quota.c</a> served us with its callaurpc function. Finally, the menu item
initial jump was provided by this nice <a href=
